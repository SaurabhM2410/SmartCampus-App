## Manual Testing Instructions

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```

3. Access the API documentation at:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application at:
   http://localhost:5173

## Test Results Summary
